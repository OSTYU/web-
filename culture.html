    <h2><u>Womens</u></h2>
    <p>Women's clothes are a way for people to show their culture. They are often brightly coloured to show off the different parts of the country. Traditional Sudanese clothing like the thobe is a work of art. Each piece tells a story through its patterns and decorations. At weddings, the bride is the focus of this cloth art; her dress and decorations represent beauty, wealth, and the religious significance of the event.</p>

<h2><u>Traditional Music</u></h2>
<div class="large-text">
<p>Music in Sudan are essential expressions of cultural identity and social cohesion. They range from the spiritual zar rituals to the dynamic beats of darbuka drums. The melodies narrate stories of love, heroism, and everyday life, echoing through the vast landscapes of Sudan.  </p>
<p>There are three main types of  traditional Sudanese musical instruments which are: Aldallouka, Alrababh and Aldar </p>

</div>
<h2><u>Aldaluka</u></h2>
<div class="large-text">
    <p>The daluka is an important part of Sudanese music. It's more than just an instrument; it's a way for people to share their culture and have fun together. Not only does this hand-held drum sound good, it also feels like Sudan's rich traditions.</p>
</div>

<div class="large-text">
    <p>The daluka is a familiar sight and sound at Sudanese gatherings. It has a unique shape and bright designs. Traditionally, women play it, and it has a special place in events like weddings, where its beat leads the dances and makes the party more fun.</p>
    
    <p>Hand-made with great care, each daluka is a work of art, with detailed patterns that often have cultural meaning. The bright colours and patterns show how different Sudan's areas are and how proud its craftspeople are of their work.</p>

    <h2><u>Traditional Sudanese weddings (Jartiq)</u></h2>
    <div class="large-text">
      
      <p>The jartiq, a set of beautifully painted pots, is a classic example of how friendly the Sudanese are. These beautiful containers are filled with fragrant oils and perfumes that represent a tradition of greeting that goes back as far as Sudanese culture itself. Anointing with scents from the jartiq is a beloved tradition that is mostly done at social events. Giving people smells as a sign of peace and respect is seen as a sign of respect.</p>
      
      <p>Each jartiq set is a work of art, representing the country's rich artistic history. They are decorated with elaborate patterns and have a bright shine. Sudanese traditions are based on kindness, so the jartiq isn't just about the smells it holds; it's also about keeping family traditions alive and strengthening community bonds.</p>
      
      <p>also there is the bride dance,the bride's dance is one of the most beautiful parts. During this tradition, the jartiq is often danced with her. The bride may walk with a jartiq in her hand, and as she does, the delicate scents of the flowers will fill the air along with music and happy ululations. The rich smells from the jartiq fill the room, representing the happy start of married life and the gifts that come with it. Aside from being beautiful to look at, this dance is also a physical experience, with the jartiq's scents adding to the happy mood of the union. if you want to watch a Sudanese weddings then click <a href="https://youtu.be/CpgkI0GWqI0?si=QiNTyNWSxDT357jG" target="_blank" title=" goes to outube" > here</a></p>

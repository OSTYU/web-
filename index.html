    <h2><u>Sudan: The Nile Country</u></h2>
    <div class="large-text">
    <p>Sudan is a country with a lot of history and beautiful natural scenery.
         It also has cities that are full of life and different kinds of people. 
         The country's towns are like little souls; 
         each one has a story that shows a different part of Sudanese character. 
         From Khartoum's busy streets and the confluence of the Nile to Omdurman's historical sounds and Port Sudan's peaceful Red Sea views,
          these cities show how the country's story has changed over time. 
          They offer a unique mix of custom, culture, and technology,
           and they welcome both locals and tourists to take part in their wide range of activities. 
           We are going to visit the three key towns that are important to Sudan's past, present, and future.</p>

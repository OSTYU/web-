<h2><u> Help Sudanese people</u></h2>
<div class="large-text">
    <p>A huge humanitarian disaster has been caused by the ongoing war in Sudan. Over six million people have been forced to leave their homes. A lot of them are children and women, who are the most likely to be hurt by this tragedy.</p>
    <p>A lot of damage has been done, and between 70% and 80% of hospitals are not working, making it harder for people to get the care they need. Because of this, about 25 million people need help right away to make sure they can stay alive. Some five million people are severely hungry, and millions of children can't go to school because their schools have been destroyed by war. This shows how bad the situation is.</p>
    <p>There have been reports of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) doing horrible things that have shocked people around the world. These include alleged war crimes like sexual assaults on women, home invasions, and attacks on citizens that were not necessary.</p>
    <p>The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has been mentioned in some of these reports regarding their support for the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which have been accused of committing serious human rights violations.</p>
    <p>In times like these, every act of kindness is very important. If you can, please think about giving money to reputable groups that are working hard on the ground to help and provide aid. Donating money can help get food and medical services back up and running and rebuild lives.</p>
    <p>For those of you who can't give money, know that your thoughts and words are just as important. Get people to know about it, stay up to date, and have talks. The phrase #KeepYourEyeOnSudan is more than just a slogan. It's a worldwide call to remember the plight of the Syrian people and not forget about them.</p>
    <p>Any kind of help you give gives people hope and shows that you are against the unfair things that many people have to deal with. We should all work together to help Sudan with our money, our words, and our hearts.</p>
